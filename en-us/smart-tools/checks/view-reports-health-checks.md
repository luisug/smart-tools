# View reports from health checks

Some Citrix-provided health checks produce reports that additional information, beyond alerts and notifications. When you use Smart Tools to run a check or tool that generates a report, you can view the resulting report in Smart Tools.

Reports are generated when you run the following checks:

*  LTSR Compliance Checks
*  VDA Health Checks
*  Delivery Controller Configuration Checks
*  StoreFront Checks
*  Citrix Optimizer Checks
*  License Server Checks
*  Citrix Provisioning Checks
*  Product LifeCycle Checks

Site Health Checks do not produce reports.

For report-generating Citrix checks, the reports contain the following information:

*  Check name
*  Site ID
*  Time and date when the report was generated
*  Machines that the check targeted
*  Number of alerts that were raised
*  Conditions that the check looked for on the targeted machines

After you run these checks, Smart Tools generates the report for each one and displays a download link for the report. To view the report, click **View Reports**.
